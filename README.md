# Facebook OSINT Tool
* A tool for more easily indexing public facebook information
* Replaces the now-removed graph search after it was removed on 19/06/19

### Disclaimer
* I don't condone using tools similar to this for e-stalking or other malicious purposes
* This tool is created with the intent to help you lock down what is visible to the public on your own account
* This is a work in progress, it does the job but I'll add to it occasionally

### Usage
`help` - List usage  
`settarget` - set the target facebook page (takes name, ID or URL)  
`setquery` - set the query that gets entered in the search box  
`addfilter` - add a filter (examples coming soon...)  
`getposts [url]` - open your query result in your browser (`url` to print url to terminal instead)   
`listvars` - list all the variables of your query  
`clear` - Clear the terminal
